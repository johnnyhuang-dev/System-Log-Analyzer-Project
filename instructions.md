Welcome to the System Log Analyzer.

To use it effectively, please follow these steps:

1. Have a list of system logs, each log in the format **[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] INFOTYPE: MESSAGE**,    
the program **will not work with any logs or data of other formats**.   
For example: [2025-11-12 10:00:01] INFO: System started

2. Ensure your logs are in this format, **one log over the other in a list**,
**no spaces or empty lines in between each log**.   
For example:   
[2025-11-12 10:00:01] INFO: System started  
[2025-11-12 10:00:05] WARNING: Unauthorized login  
[2025-11-12 10:00:08] ERROR: Unsuccessful port access

3. Upload / copypaste your logs into the "**uploaded_logs.txt**" file  
and ensure no spaces or empty lines before or between the list of logs.

4. Open the "**main.py**" file.

5. Run the program by typing "**python main.py**" in the bottom Terminal (or bash shell), 
or press **Run** button at the top-right corner.

6. Follow instructions carefully from the Terminal to see log analysis.
